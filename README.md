# MNIST-Machine-Learning

In this notebook, I use the following methods for classifying handwritten digits: 

* [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
* [Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.html)
* [k-nearest neighbors (KNN)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)

The problem addressed here was originally posed by the US Post Office. One of the data sets was assembled by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and today is a [standard learning tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) used in machine learning. Two MNIST datasets are looked at here. One is a smaller with a 1797 images and the second is the full dataset using 70,000 images. On the smaller dataset I perform logistic regression and KNN. For the larger dataset I perform logistic regression, LDA and KNN. 

Packages used here:
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
